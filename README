Defenders of the ERb
=====================================================

Defenders of the ERb is a simple plugin for Rails.
It sits in your project counting uncached database calls in your views,
and warns you when you overdo it.

It tries to connect to gravatar to get a picture of me,
but you can ensure full MatthewRudy-goodness by running the command;

  rake freeze:matthewrudy

Enjoy.
